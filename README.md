I built this while coding along to Dan Abramov's [redux tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree)

It was useful because it included patterns I had not seen before including 

1. Separating reducer logic into separate reducers
2. Combining it with `combineReducers`
3. `createStore`
